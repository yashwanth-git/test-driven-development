# Test Driven Development

This is a personal lab where I try my best to follow test driven development.

## Personal Understanding on TDD

- Gives confidence to ship the code
- Guides us to switch to clean code [Need to add more about it]
- Forces other devs to also write clean code [To a certain extent]
- Not necessary to check each and every div, span; can focus on the functionalities which needs attention

## Todos

- [x] Setup React TypeScript Project using yarn
- [x] Setup lint, jest and prettier
- [x] Setup basic CI
- [ ] Decide the components visualizing the tests
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Build components

## Setup

- React with TypeScript using yarn
- Precommit checks using husky
- Prettier for linting
- CI to check basic installations and test
